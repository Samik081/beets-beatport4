**beets Beatport API v4 compatible plugin**
==================================================

.. image:: http://img.shields.io/pypi/v/beets-beatport4.svg
    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/beets-beatport4

Plugin for `beets <https://github.com/beetbox/beets>`_ to replace stock beatport plugin and use Beatport API v4 as an
autotagger source.

As Beatport had killed their API v3, the stock beatport plugin does not work anymore. It is also currently not possible to request the access to the API "normal" way (by using your client credentials or API token generated by Beatport), so I have found workaround that uses public API client id used for `Beatport docs frontend <https://api.beatport.com/v4/docs/>`_ and updated the code to use the new specification.

For more info, see the discussion on this issue: https://github.com/beetbox/beets/issues/3862

I have also opened a pull request in the official beets repository (https://github.com/beetbox/beets/pull/4477), so if it gets merged, I am probably going to take down this plugin.

Installation
------------

Install this plugin with

..

   $ pip install beets-beatport4

and add ``beatport4`` to the ``plugins`` list in your beets config file.

Beatport Authorization
----------------------
There are two ways of acquiring user access token to the Beatport v4 API using
this plugin.

Method 1: username and password
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This method is fully automatic and relies on holding your Beatport username
and password inside your beets config file.
It will authorize to the Beatport API using ``authorization_code`` grant type
and ``client_id`` provided by beatport for the sake of their ``swagger-ui``
frontend in which you can test their API: https://api.beatport.com/v4/docs/
By default, ``client_id`` is scrapped automatically from the above URL.
Alternatively, you can also pass it via plugin configuration.

Steps:

1. Add ``beatport4`` plugin to your ``beets/config.yaml`` plugins list
2. Add below configuration and fill your credentials

.. code-block:: yaml

    beatport4:
        username: <YOUR_BEATPORT_USERNAME>
        password: <YOUR_BEATPORT_PASSWORD>


Method 2. copy token from the browser
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You will probably want to use this method if you don't want to store your
credentials unencrypted within the config file. Also, it will be helpful if
for any reason something goes wrong during the username/password authorization
process.

This is also a fallback method if you provide wrong credentials in the config.

Steps:

1. Add ``beatport4`` plugin to your ``beets/config.yaml`` plugins list
2. When the first import with plugin enabled happens, you will be prompted to paste the access token JSON
3. Visit https://api.beatport.com/v4/docs/
4. Open Network tab in your browser and start capturing the traffic
5. Login with your Beatport account
6. Search for the following request: ``https://api.beatport.com/v4/auth/o/token/``
7. Copy the response (whole JSON structure)
8. Paste it to the terminal (or `beatport_token.json` file next to your ``beets/config.yaml`` - you can check the path by running ``beet config --paths`` command)
9. If the token expires, you will be prompted again and required to repeat above steps

Configuration
-------------
.. code-block:: yaml

    beatport4:
        username: <YOUR_BEATPORT_USERNAME>
        password: <YOUR_BEATPORT_PASSWORD>
        client_id: <BEATPORT_API_CLIENT_ID> # optional, you can set it, but it should be scrapped automatically from the docs

Apart from the above, plugin should work exactly the same way as the stock one, so please refer to the `official documentation <https://beets.readthedocs.io/en/v1.6.0/plugins/beatport.html>`_
